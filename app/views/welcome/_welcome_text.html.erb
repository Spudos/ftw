  <p class="p-2">As a manager, you will create your team and define their strategies. The match results are determined by a combination of team statistics, player skills, and tactical decisions. You will submit various actions via the turnsheet, such as training sessions, transfers, and match strategies. These will then be processed, including match results, league standings, and individual player performances and the website will be updated to reflect the weeks outcomes.</p>
  <p class="p-2">Community Engagement: One of the key aspects of PBEM football is the strong community that forms around it. Players often discuss strategies, share their experiences, and engage in friendly banter about their teams and rivalries. This social element adds depth and excitement to the game, as players feel a sense of camaraderie and competition.</p>
